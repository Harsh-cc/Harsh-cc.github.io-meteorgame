The red object is made up of a special type of matter which exerts attractive and repulsive forces on matter at the same time sometimes attractive and sometimes repulsive force becomes larger and any objects which come near it starts behaving like it and start exerting repulsive and attractive forces which are unpredictable to say when attractive and when repulsive force becomes larger . Enjoy this special situation and protect red object so that scientist can do research on it :) .
